# python-challenge
Created a directory for both of the Python Challenges: PyBank and  PyPoll

Inside each directory is the following:
 - A ile called main.py. which is the main script to run for each analysis.
 - A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files you used. 
 - An "analysis" folder that contains text file that has the results from the analysis.
 
 ## PyBank
 In this challenge, we were tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the company. We were given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.
 
Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
 - The total number of months included in the dataset
 - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
 - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
 
### Results:
